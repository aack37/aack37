    "It's a cold January evening somewhere in America. You're watching your favorite NFL team in a playoff game, tied at 20 with the clock slowly ticking. The other team has the ball, but their drive has stalled at midfield. \"*Iiiiit's 4th dooowwwwwn!*\", cries a familiar voice from above the stadium. They're going for it. Even from the TV, you know that the roar of the crowd is deafening. Their quarterback tries to tune out the noise, the pressure of the moment. Could it all come down to this *one play...?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, and 4th down attempts might just be my favorite moments in all of sports. The risk is massive, but the rewards are so enticing that many teams just can't resist. Many legends have been born, many memories made, hearts broken and coaches fired, on the infamous 4th down conversion attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this means coaches are usually okay with just punting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this statistical analysis, I want to explore the decision-making of 2021 NFL teams on 4th down, and see what circumstances warrant a team's decision on that particular down: When it's best to go for it, kick a field goal, or just punt it away."

    "\n",
    "For a full explanation of the rules of NFL football, [here](https://www.liveabout.com/football-101-the-basics-of-football-1333784) is an article that goes into detail. For this analysis, however, we only need to understand certain aspects of the game, so I'm going to explain those briefly here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we only care about *drives* in football. A **drive** is when one team is on offense, trying to push the ball as far as they can down the field. The other team is on defense, trying to stop them. The offense can make it all the way to the other team's end zone for a **touchdown** (worth anywhere from 6-8 points), or come up short but still go far enough to kick a **field goal** (worth 3 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "The offense has 4 chances, or **downs**, to make this happen. Obviously, the 100 yard football field is a long way to go with just 4 plays- so, to help the offense out, if they move the ball just 10 yards from where they started the drive, they get a **first down**. Now, they have 4 more plays to make it the next 10 yards, for the next first down. This goes on until they score, or they commit a **turnover**- giving the ball up to the other team.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, it's hopefully clear why 4th down is so important. For the offense, it's their last chance to make something happen on the drive. For the defense, it's their chance to make a big stop and get some rest off the field."

    "### BACKGROUND INFO:  Choices on 4th down\n",
    "\n",
    "The defense's goal is simple: stop the offense. On offense, all teams generally make one of 3 decisions on 4th down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FIELD GOAL:** Try and kick the field goal for 3 points. If you make the field goal, you **kickoff** the ball to the other team (which usually starts their drive about 25 yards down the field.) If you miss it, they get the ball right where you left it.\n",
    "2. **GO FOR IT:** Try and get to the first down marker or the end zone. If you make it, you get a first down (or a touchdown!) But if you don't, the other team gets the ball right where you left it, known as a **turnover on downs.**\n",
    "3. **PUNT:** Have a player essentially drop kick the ball as far as they can down the field. Wherever the other team gets it is where they'll start their drive. NFL Punters can usually punt the ball about 50-60 yards.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we can see, scoring points aren't the only thing that matters on 4th down. *Positioning* is also crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you go for it at your own 1 yard line and fail, you've given your opponent the ball at the 1- an easy chance for them to score a touchdown. Even if you make the first down, you'll still have a long way to go before you get any points. So in this case, punting is your best option. You won't score points, but at least you'll push your opponent farther back, and give your defense a better chance to make a stop. 0 points is better than -6, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was an example of an obvious choice, but things can get very hazy in actual games. What if you're not deep in your own territory, but instead at midfield? What if it's 4th down at your *opponent's* 1 yard line- do you really settle for the field goal, when you're so close to the touchdown? How does the score, time on the clock, and general situation of the game impact your decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the kind of question I hope to answer with my analysis."

    "The Denver Broncos (DEN) played the most 4th downs, and the Kansas City Chiefs (KAN) played by far the fewest. One possible explanation for this is that, in terms of offense, the two teams are on opposite ends of the spectrum. NFL fans know that the Chiefs are one of the highest-scoring offenses in the league, rarely being held to 4th down, while the Broncos are ultra-conservative and like winning games with their defense."

    "### Advanced Analysis\n",

    "Our ultimate goal is to get a predictor for what a coach will do on a given 4th down, and for that we need to know what decisions were made on all the 4th downs we have so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a \"result\" column, but it tells us the result of the drive, not the play. For the play, we have to look through the \"details\" column, and this is where a rudimentary form of NL Processing comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we simply look through the details column for key words that would tell us what the play is: \"punt\" would only appear in a punt play, and likewise for a field goal. Conversion attempts can be listed as many different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even if the play goes wrong (punt is blocked, field goal misses, etc.) We only care about what the coach *intended* to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalties are the hardest to classify because they can work with or against the offense, and they can even be accepted or declined by either team. Typically, when a penalty is accepted, the play doesn't count and the ball is moved up or down the field some amount of yards. So for now, we will give all accepted penalties a special category, and mostly ignore them in our analysis."

    "In this project, we took a tour of the entire data science pipeline, and learned a bit about professional football too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by **scraping** the website https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ for data on 2021 NFL games. It was by far the longest and most challenging part of the project, since we had to first understand what methods they were using to store their data. We recognized that each game is stored under its own URL in the ProFootballReference database, and we determined those URLs must be by scraping a separate page off of ProFootballReference that contained the 2021 NFL schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we **tidied** our data tables, which was also a difficult task. We wanted to know which team was on offense during each 4th down, so we had to match our table of 4th down plays to the table of drives for each game. From that we deduced what team was on offense, and also learned some other useful information, such as the length of the drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combined both of these steps in scraping all the URLs (or at least, as many of them as my CPU could handle), and aggregating them into one gigantic database of 4th downs across the league this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we performed **exploratory data analysis.** We wanted to answer some burning questions, such as: What teams face 4th down most and least often? When in drives do 4th downs usually happen? And, how often is each decision made in general?\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we did our **advanced analysis**, and tried to observe some trends in 4th-down decision making. We created and tested hypotheses on how *positioning*, *score*, and *game clock* affected our decisions. We created stacked bar graphs to illustrate how frequently coaches punt, kick field goals, and go for it with each of these considerations individually taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, with the help of Python's sklearn we crafted a **decision tree** that could help us make the tough calls. We picked a decision tree because it was the best mechanism to predict a decision based on the attributes of position, score and time. Our decision tree performed fairly well, matching the coach's choice quite often.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this tutorial/project hybrid has been insightful to you in learning about data and the NFL!\n",
